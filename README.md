# React-JS-Sequence-Board-Game
This Sequence Board game can be played by 4 players in real time. The game waits for all the four players to join the game. Once all players are ready, the game starts automatically.
The Game is built in React JS along with the socket programming.

## How to run the game?

Write the following command on the terminal in the game directory folder to start the server:
```
node server.js
```

Now, paste the following link on your browser:
http://localhost:8000/mydoc.
